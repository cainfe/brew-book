# brew-book
A personal project born from my love for coffee. This application aims to be a digital companion for my brewing adventures, helping me track my coffee journey and refine my brewing techniques.

### Key Features:
 * Brewing Log: Meticulously record brewing methods (pour over, French press, etc.), grind size, water temperature, and other crucial parameters.
 * Tasting Notes: Capture the nuances of each cup with detailed tasting notes, including acidity, body, sweetness, and flavor profiles.
 * Journal Entries: Document thoughts, reflections, and any brewing adjustments made for future reference.

### Technologies Used:
 * Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 * Backend: PHP (Optional - for future expansion).
 * Database: SQLite (for local storage), with potential for migration to MySQL for a multi-user version.

### Project Status:
This is an ongoing project. Expect ongoing development and updates as I continue to refine my brewing skills and expand the capabilities of this application.

### Contributing:
While primarily a personal project, I welcome contributions from fellow coffee enthusiasts! Feel free to fork this repository and experiment with your own ideas.
